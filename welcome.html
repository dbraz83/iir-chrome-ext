<h1>Information Interaction of ESL user' Study</h1>
</br>
    <h2>Information Sheet</h2>

<h3>Background to the study</h3>
<p>
    When people come to the UK to live or visit, they often have to use local or national government websites for information on a range of topics. It is also possible to find some of this information from non-government sources. If English is not their first language, it may be difficult to know where to go, and what information is useful or that can be trusted as being correct. Therefore, I am interested in how people who speak English as a second language find information on governmental topics using the internet.</p>
    <h3>Goals/Outcomes</h3>
<p>This study aims to look at the information seeking skills of the people who take part to help in the design of websites and their content (for example www.gov.uk), search engines (like Google) and to improve teaching of IT and digital literacy skills.</p>

    <h3>Study Design: What is involved?</h3>
    
<p>To understand the information needs of the people who help in this study, and English as second language users in general, this study includes an experiment and a few questionnaires. 
</br>
The information that will be collected in the questionnaires include details of age, occupation, language skills, I.T and Information Literacy levels. As well as the collection of personal opinions on the experiences and views about the tasks carried out in the study.
</br>The experiment will be conducted at Northumbria University, using PC’s. You will have four tasks to complete. Each task includes a story in which people are facing a real-life issue that requires searching information from the internet. Your task will be to search for webpages that best answer this issue.</p>
