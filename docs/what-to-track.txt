Must haves:
---------------
(DONE) Log Search results link clicked
(DONE) Log Link Rank
(DONE) Search query submit
(DONE) UserID or Session ID to track over multiple tabs/windows/when browser is closed and reopened
(?) Track:
	- search no.
	- user navigation
	- Total time spent on document session
	
Read/Write log to file
	- create file
	- check file exists
	- append file on the fly?
	- compartmentalise for .csv?

Would be nice:
-------------
Bookmark tracking
Track and log time spent on individual documents
Time spent typing search query

maybe:
--------
Set a timer with a popup
Questionnaires ~ pre/post/study (demographics)
Check use of assistance/autocorrect/recommended links when querying
